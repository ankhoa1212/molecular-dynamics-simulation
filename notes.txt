crystal --> stable --> molecules form structure instantly
crsystal --> meta-stable --> molecules slowly form structure
liquid --> molecules don't come together

vary the number of molecules and the strength
visually check and provide reasoning for why the crystallization is classified in a certain way
graph a phase diagram based on different parameters

YOLO --> understand basics for training from scratch

train a new dataset
talk to Julianna about training dataset
